      <h2>About HephzibahZion</h2>
      <p>
        HephzibahZion is a faith-driven creative space founded by a woman of
        grace and strength. What began as a small love for handmade fashion has
        grown into a ministry of beauty, purpose, and truth. From hand-crafted
        hats to faith-nourishing Christian books, everything here is crafted to
        inspire and uplift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esther Olasunmbo - the heart behind HephzibahZion - creates each hat
        with love, and curates books that speak to the soul. May every visit
        here fill you with elegance, hope, and a daily word from God.
